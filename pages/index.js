                My name is Parker Henderson, currently I work as a product designer at Jumpstart where I focus designing better, more equitable recruiting software. More specifically, I work on our design system and integrations products that allow our customers to supercharge their data and workflows.
              </p>
              <p className="body-lg paragraph">
                Previously, I worked at Red Bull and a few startups you've probably never heard about. I spend my free time thinking and reading about product & design strategy, tinkering with software, and learning new things.
